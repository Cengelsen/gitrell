# Gitrell

## What is this?

This is a simple script that "synchronizes" all your git-repos in a given folder with the remote repo.

## How does it work?

It uses Shell-scripting to loop through your folders, and the branches of the repos in those folder, and performs git-commands to "synchronize" your local repo with your remote repo.

## How do I run it locally?

1. ```git clone https://github.com/Cengelsen/gitrell.git```.
2. Copy the file to a folder of repos.
3. Make sure it's an executable, ```chmod +x gitrell.sh```.
4. Run the script. 
5. Sit back and enjoy :)
